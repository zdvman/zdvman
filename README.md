### **ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dmytro Zuiev!**  

Iâ€™m a **Full-Stack Developer** with a background thatâ€™s anything but ordinary. After running a successful **luxury travel business** for over a decade, I made a bold transition into techâ€”driven by a fascination with **AI, automation, and scalable software solutions**.  

Now, I specialize in **JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AI-powered applications**, building systems that blend **efficiency, intelligence, and real-world impact**. My expertise spans **geolocation-based applications, backend optimization, and CI/CD automation**, with a strong foundation in **problem-solving and business-driven development**.  

What sets me apart? **Adaptability, resilience, and a strategic mindset.** I donâ€™t just write codeâ€”I **solve problems, optimize processes, and think beyond the feature set** to deliver meaningful, high-impact solutions.  

ðŸš€ **Always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities.** Letâ€™s connect!
